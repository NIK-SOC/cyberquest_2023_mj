Upon modifying an open-source library for our company's needs for the super secret interworkings the developer caught a ransom that corrupted all data present on their developer PC. All files produced by this library were lost. The only thing we have now is a dump of all variable set calls since this was successfully restored from the RAM. Think of this dump like placing `printf` calls at every single variable update. Altough the developer was so desperate that he quit the other day, I trust you to find this open-source library and recover the original file. All I know is that it was written in C. Probably a decoder? How would I know, I am just a CEO... The company awaits for a hero!
