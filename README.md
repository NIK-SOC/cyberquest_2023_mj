# cyberquest_2023_mj
Source code for some of [MJ's](https://github.com/Diniboy1123) CTF challenges for the CyberQuest 2023 event.

The repository is fairly huge, this is mainly due to the fact that I have included pre-built binaries for the challenges, so you can easily reproduce each step and we don't have to rebuild the binaries every time.

Most of the source is messy and might require some adjustments to have it working outside of our infrastructure. In doubt, feel free to contact me. As an excuse: this code was never meant to be public, I just wanted to share it with the participants of the event.

Each challenge has a README.md file with a short, usually spoiler free description and a little how-to. If you expand the spoiler part you also see a full write-up. Most subfolders should have a poc script ready for you as well with one possible solution.

There are many subfolders, many of them are using different OSS libraries and therefore have different licenses. Therefore I haven't included a LICENSE file in the root folder. If you want to use any of the code, do some research on the used libraries and their licenses. I tried to keep the original licenses for each used library in the respective subfolder.
