## Hint for free

Would you look at that! I just found this on a note deep down in my locker: `^(?:([^:/?#.]+):)?(?:\/\/(?:([^/?#]*)@)?([^/#?]*?)(?::([0-9]+))?(?=[/#?]|$))?([^?#]+)?(?:\?([^#]*))?(?:#([\s\S]*))?$` can you make sense out of it? Maybe its of use for you.

It also mentioned some RFCs. Who doesn't love reading RFCs? I sleep to them! Here is my favorite: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986 I heard Google doesn't and they fell for it too. But will you?

\+ I hope you found the other port for the frontend.
